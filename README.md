**DubbyXD/DubbyXD** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m  working on an open-source AI-powered discord bot. This will not be just a 'chatbot'. I want it to have features such as role creation, auto-modding based on NLP. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Computer Vision. Object classification, CNN's and 3D CNN's
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for other AI enthusiasts to collab with, and talk about nerd stuff with.
- ðŸ¤– You'll probably find me contributing to machine learning algorithims or backend web applications.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about data science stuff <3
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: The best way to reach me is Twitter or Discord.
